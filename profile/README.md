# Adaptation and Resilience to Climate Extremes and Multi-hazard Events "ARCEME"

## Project Objectives
The aim of ESA-funded project “Adaptation and Resilience to Climate Extremes and Multi-hazard events—ARCEME” (June 2024 - May 2026) is to develop a framework to assess the biophysical and socio-economic impacts of cascading multi-hazard extreme events from a variety of angles and scales, relying on the power of EO. 
The specific objectives are :
1. to produce a database of cascading extreme events that **combine drought, heat and heavy precipitation**
2. to extract high resolution **data cubes of Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 Earth Observation data** to characterize the identified events, understand their complex dynamics and determine their **impact on the land surface and vegetation**
3. to develop analytical **case studies** at different scales and to operationalize the use of EO data towards vulnerability assessment and disaster risk reduction.
